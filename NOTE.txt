FPStation 13, based on rev 1008 6/17/14 (its really 1011, but the only changes were to make it work with modern byond and to increase the LAC's internal volume)

Issues:
The last revs of FPStation sadly had power (and potentially lighting) be several levels of fucked because carn broke it and left it broke.
So expect those to likely not work well, if at all.

Warning:
Also be aware various crashing stuff hasnt been fixed/patched.
The big one that comes to mind is how paper can be used to crash the server with a script or something.
Also there is NO utf scanning code that I know of.
